</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In HTML, a list is a structural element used to organize and present information in a clear, readable format. HTML provides three main types of lists. 
    <li>Unordered Lists : These lists are used when the order of the items is not important. Each list item is typically marked with a bullet point.
    <li>Ordered Lists : These lists are used when the order of the items is significant. Each list item is typically marked with numbers, letters, or Roman numerals, by default.
